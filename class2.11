Class 2.11 was simply a lecture, submission of "build-a-blog" and starting "Blogz".
I would cheesily like to note that I completely built the Blogs app before reading
the instructions for Build-A-Blog.  I diminished and refactored to make build-a-blog.
I am certain that there is a commit with all of that original code.  This may be
a good time to further Git skills.
