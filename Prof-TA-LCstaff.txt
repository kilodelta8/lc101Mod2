I started class/studio 2.7 ahead as I was excited to start SQL.  I have been meaning to get
a headsup on SQL for quite some time now.  I forgot to make the branch studioN, rather it says
class2.7.  Let me just say that last exercise was rough.  Those sql join clauses are intense.

I realize that I should just call these branches by the studio name rather than classes.
Nonetheless, I added further functionality to the Flicklist4 studio.  It now lists the
movies the user adds on the "home" screen, as well as dynamically adds them to the dropdown
for future removal.  The downfall is it saves as a list until the script stops.  I reckon 
the future will hold SQL instructions.

Completed walkthrough/studio for class 2.5 on git branch "class2.5".
Added virtual env folder (on my end) to .gitignore.

Hey guys.  Thank you for letting me finish the program remotely.
I am not sure how you wish to track my progress outside of being present in class
and assignments.  I figured if I made a repo you could spot check here and there
would be ideal.  I will probably follow LC suit and make each class day a seperate
branch (i.e. Today would be <branch class2.5> ).
