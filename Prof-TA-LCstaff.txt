Hey everyone.  This installment (branch) was labeled "flicklist7".  I apologize for the 
naming conventions for the branches following my progress.
Flicklist 7 is really cementing some of the mroe exciting concepts, and I am thoroughly
enjoying it.
I gotta say thanks again for letting me work remotely.

Happy Easter everyone.  Hope those who see this have a splendid day.  The studio for class2.9
was fun.  There was a bump in the road with SQL, but it's clicked and I am enjoying the functionality
of being able to utilize a database.  This opens many new doors for new project.  Im pumped!
What is committed for class2.9 is screenshots fo the website and db working.  I can add all
the code and files if you wish.  I just haven't figured out an easy way to move files from one 
repo to another, then close the folder and move into a different.  It would be a labor of love,
no doubt.  Anyways, hope this has proven a valuable method of proving my keeping up in class
as a remote loner.  It's pretty nice that I still have classmates reaching out for help, and being
able to do so remotely.

Not going to lie here, that SQL business is intense.  I can sling python, c++, etc all day long
but SQL is killing me.  Woof......  Exciting nonetheless.

I realize that I should just call these branches by the studio name rather than classes.
Nonetheless, I added further functionality to the Flicklist4 studio.  It now lists the
movies the user adds on the "home" screen, as well as dynamically adds them to the dropdown
for future removal.  The downfall is it saves as a list until the script stops.  I reckon 
the future will hold SQL instructions.

Completed walkthrough/studio for class 2.5 on git branch "class2.5".
Added virtual env folder (on my end) to .gitignore.

Hey guys.  Thank you for letting me finish the program remotely.
I am not sure how you wish to track my progress outside of being present in class
and assignments.  I figured if I made a repo you could spot check here and there
would be ideal.  I will probably follow LC suit and make each class day a seperate
branch (i.e. Today would be <branch class2.5> ).
